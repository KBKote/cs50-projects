# cs50-projects

This repository contains my solutions and notes from **Harvard University’s CS50** course.  
It reflects my learning process as I work through the problem sets and core concepts of computer science.

## Structure
The repository is organized by week and topic, following the CS50 curriculum:

- `week0-scratch/` — Scratch projects  
- `week1-c/` — C fundamentals (Mario, Cash, Readability, etc.)
- `week2-arrays/`
- `week3-algorithms/`
- *(additional weeks added as completed)*

Each folder contains the source code for that problem set and may include brief notes.

## How to Run
Most programs can be compiled and run using CS50’s tools. Example:

```bash
make readability
./readability
