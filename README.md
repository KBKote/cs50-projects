# cs50-projects

This repository contains my solutions and notes from **Harvard University’s CS50** course.  
It reflects my learning process as I work through the problem sets and core concepts of computer science.

## Structure
The repository is organized by week and topic, following the CS50 curriculum:

- `week1-c/` — C fundamentals (Mario, Cash, Readability, etc.)
- `week2-arrays/`
- `week3-algorithms/`
- *(additional weeks added as completed)*

Each folder contains the source code for that problem set and may include brief notes.

## How to Run

These programs were written and tested using **CS50’s development environment** (CS50 Codespace), which includes the required CS50 library (`cs50.h`).

### Requirements
To run the programs, you will need:
- A C compiler (`clang` or `gcc`)
- The CS50 library  
- Or access to **CS50 Codespace** (recommended)

Using CS50 Codespace is the easiest option, as no additional setup is required.
